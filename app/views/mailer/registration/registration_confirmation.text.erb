Below are some quick notes and tips:

- All classes will be conducted using Zoom.

- All students are required to attend all regularly scheduled classes unless an absence has been discussed with Miss Serena.

- All students are expected to arrive 5 minutes prior to the start time of each class.

- All students are expected to sit in the chair and have a clear table in the front with the study papers, pencils and markers.

Thanks,
