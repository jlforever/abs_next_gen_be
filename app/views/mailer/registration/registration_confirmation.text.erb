Dear <%= @parent_first_name %>,

We are very pleased that you've registered with Alpha Beta Academy for: <%= @klass_category %>. You can send a PayPal payment of an amount of $<%= @fee.to_s %> payable to account: admin@alphabetaschool.org. For PayPal, select option 'Pay to family or friends' to save the transaction processing fees. Alternatively, you can also send a Zelle payment of an amount of $<%= @fee.to_s %>, payable to account: admin@alphabetaschool.org. For either PayPal or Zelle, make sure to annotate in the payment note: 孩子的名字和报名的课程. Please send the payment by <%= @total_due_by.strftime("%m-%d-%Y %H:%M:%S") %> to avoid the possibility of registration cancellation.

Once we have received the payment and have processed the registration, we will send out a confirmation email detailing the next steps.

Below are some quick notes and tips:

- All classes will be conducted using Zoom.

- All students are required to attend all regularly scheduled classes unless an absence has been discussed with Miss Serena.

- All students are expected to arrive 5 minutes prior to the start time of each class.

- All students are expected to sit in the chair and have a clear table in the front with the study papers, pencils and markers.

Thanks,
